# TASK 1

Build out a graph from the
dataset given, and record how the graph and its properties change over time.
You are expected to perform this task on at least 5 properties, and report
interesting insights. Few simple properties include different types of centrality,
density, and diameter. This task is focused on exploratory data analysis, and you
are expected to show plots and metrics to support your findings.
